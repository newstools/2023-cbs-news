The weekend is finally here. In a busy news week, we reported about an Oregon man stranded in the snow who used his drone to call for help, the 10 most pet-friendly cities for renters and a monument that was unveiled honoring abolitionist Harriet Tubman. Also, vinyl record sales topped CDs for the first time since 1987, we offered sleep tips as daylight saving time arrives this weekend (don't forget to spring those clocks forward), and the world mourned the losses of actor Robert Blake and Tom Jackson from "Queer Eye." But that's not nearly all. Below is our weekly Saturday Six, a recap of half a dozen news stories — in no particular order — ranging from the heartfelt to the weird to the tragic, and everything in between. See you next week.
