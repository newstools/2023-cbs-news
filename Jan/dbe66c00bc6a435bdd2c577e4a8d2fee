By Washington Post book critic Ron Charles Before we say good-bye to 2022, I want to look back and tell you about five of my favorite novels of this year. Barbara Kingsolver has taken Charles Dickens' classic novel, "David Copperfield," and transformed it into her own modern-day masterpiece. "Demon Copperhead" is about a boy in Appalachia trying to find his way in the world while struggling with foster care and opioid addiction. It's as funny as it is heartbreaking, and it's got a voice that leaps right off the page.

To toughen him up, his alcoholic mother sends him on a camping trip with a couple of guys from her AA meeting. Unfortunately, they're not at all what they seem, and you'll wish you could protect Young Mungo from what's ahead.

This is the story about wealthy triplets who hate each other, and then discover a secret about their father that reorders their lives. Korelitz uses this witty family epic to explore modern art, liberal education, political correctness, and American spirituality, while delivering one surprise after another.

Set in the early 20th century, it turns the old story of colonization on its head by pushing the Europeans into the background, and letting us follow the intersecting lives of villagers in East Africa as they struggle to survive and thrive.
