Washington â€” The House failed to elect a speaker for the seventh and eighth time in three days on Thursday, with GOP Rep. Kevin McCarthy again stymied by a conservative faction that vehemently opposes his candidacy. The California Republican made two key concessions to the 21 conservative holdouts on Wednesday, but none of them supported him in the latest rounds of voting. With 433 members voting Thursday, a majority of 217 votes were needed to secure the speaker's gavel, meaning McCarthy could only afford a handful of defections within the House GOP's thin majority. The continuing impasse leaves the House effectively in limbo, since lawmakers must first elect a speaker before moving on to other business in the new Congress. McCarthy's conservative critics say he can't be trusted to lead the House GOP, and have largely thrown their support behind Rep. Byron Donalds from Florida. Former President Donald Trump and GOP Rep. Kevin Hern also received votes one and two votes, respectively. Democrats, meanwhile, have remained united behind New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black party leader in either chamber of Congress. Jeffries and his lieutenants said Democrats "are united and are committed to staying in Washington for as long as it takes to get the Congress organized."
