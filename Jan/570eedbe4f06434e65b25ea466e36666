"Spare" has already stirred up headlines, with claims that Prince William physically attacked Prince Harry in their feud over Harry and Meghan's treatment. In a clip from the 60 Minutes interview released earlier this week, Harry said he'd tried to keep his conversations with the British royal family private, but to combat stories in the tabloids, he's been forced to make his concerns public. "Every single time I've tried to do it privately there have been briefings and leakings and planting of stories against me and my wife," he told Cooper in the clip. "You know, the family motto is never complain, never explain, but it's just a motto." "There's a lot of complaining and a lot of explaining… being done through leaks." Cooper said to Harry. "They will feed or have a conversation with the correspondent," Harry explained. "And that correspondent will literally be spoon-fed information and write the story. And at the bottom of it they will say that they've reached out to Buckingham Palace for comment. But the whole story is Buckingham Palace commenting. So when we're being told for the last six years, 'We can't put a statement out to protect you.' But you do it for other members of the family. It becomes— there becomes a point when silence is betrayal."
