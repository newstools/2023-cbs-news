"As everyone knows I have an extremely busy work and travel schedule but nothing gets me more excited than becoming a mom in 2023!" Hilton's mom, Kathy Hilton, spoke about her daughter's IVF journey on E! News. "It breaks my heart because I know she is trying and trying and I always say, 'Just relax,'" she said. "So many people, they struggle and it doesn't just happen like that."
