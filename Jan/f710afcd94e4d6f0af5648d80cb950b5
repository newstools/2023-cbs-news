President Biden on Friday awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal to law enforcement and state and local officials who defended the U.S. Capitol and upheld the integrity of the 2020 election. This is the first time Mr. Biden has offered the Presidential Citizens Medal, and it comes two years after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. In a White House ceremony Friday, President Biden gave the award to 12 people, including former Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, former Metropolitan Police Department officer Michael Fanone, and Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman. The late Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick also received the award posthumously. Mr. Biden delivered remarks as the country marks two years since pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol and law enforcement defended it so lawmakers, their staffs, and the vice president would be safe. These are the people Mr. Biden honored Friday: — Nikole Killion contributed to this report
