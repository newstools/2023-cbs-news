During a busy news week, the Golden Globe Awards returned to air after a two-year hiatus, nurses at two New York City hospitals ended a three-day strike, and there were some notable celebrity deaths, including Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, and guitarist Jeff Beck. Also, Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin was discharged from a New York hospital nine days after suffering cardiac arrest during an NFL game, actor Shemar Moore announced he's going to be a first-time dad at 52, and the California drought is causing some to overdraft groundwater. But that's not nearly all. Below is our weekly Saturday Six, a recap of half a dozen stories news stories — in no particular order — ranging from the heartfelt to the weird to the tragic, and everything in between.
