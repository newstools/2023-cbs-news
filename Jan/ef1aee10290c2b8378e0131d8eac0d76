The death toll in last weekend's shooting in Monterey Park, California, rose to 11 on Monday, officials announced. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services said in a statement one of the four victims taken to LA County-USC Medical Center for treatment has died. One of the wounded patients at the hospital was in serious condition, and the two others were recovering, the department said. The suspect, Huu Can Tran, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound Sunday, authorities said. The suspect used the van to flee after attempting to attack a second dance hall. All but one of the victims were 60 or older, according to information released Monday by the Los Angeles coroner's office providing the first identifications. The shootings during Lunar New Year celebrations sent a wave of fear through Asian American communities and cast a shadow over festivities nationwide. The massacre was the nation's fifth mass killing this month, and it struck one of California's largest celebrations of a holiday observed in many Asian cultures, dealing another blow to a community that has been the target of high-profile violence in recent years. It was also the deadliest attack since May 24, when 21 people were killed in an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. This is a developing story and will be updated.
