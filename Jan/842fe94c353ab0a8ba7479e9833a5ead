Watch "48 Hours: The Idaho Student Murders" Authorities in Idaho released new details Thursday from the investigation leading up to the arrest of a suspect in the murders of four University of Idaho students. Bryan Kohberger was arrested in Pennsylvania and faces charges of first-degree murder for the stabbing deaths of Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin in Moscow, Idaho, in November. Kohberger is also charged with felony burglary. Kohberger appeared in an Idaho courtroom Thursday for his first hearing since he was extradited to the state. The judge ordered him held without bail. The attorney for his extradition hearing in Pennsylvania, Monroe County public defender Jason LaBar, said "This is out of character for Bryan, these allegations." Ahead of the Idaho hearing, authorities released court documents providing details about the investigation and the evidence police say they've uncovered.
