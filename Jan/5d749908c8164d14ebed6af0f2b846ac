Will Smith, who is receiving praise for his role in the film "Emancipation," is among this year's NAACP Image Awards nominees. The film — which earned Smith a nomination for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture — is Smith's first major project since he slapped Chris Rock on stage during the Academy Awards ceremony in March after the comedian made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, told "CBS Mornings" on Thursday that Smith's work in the film was worthy of the nomination and that the NAACP nominates based on projects, not individuals. "No individual should be measured on the worst day of their life. Everyone needs redemption. And the actual depiction of that story is great," Johnson said. "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever," which was released last year, is nominated for Outstanding Motion Picture. Angela Bassett, Mary J. Blige, Quinta Brunson, Viola Davis and Zendaya are all nominated for one of the highest awards: Entertainer of the Year. The 54th NAACP Image Awards is bringing back an in-person audience for the first time since 2020 and will be broadcast live from Los Angeles. The two-hour special will air on Saturday, Feb. 25, at 8/7c on BET.
