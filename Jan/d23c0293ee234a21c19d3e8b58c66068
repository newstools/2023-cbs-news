The weekend is finally here. During another busy news week, paleontologists made a rare discovery of 256 dinosaur egg fossils in India, the technology industry continued to slash jobs and alcohol-related liver disease was found to be on the rise among young people. Also, a polar bear that killed a mom and her son in Alaska also chased school staffers and nearly got inside the building. Meanwhile, the world said goodbye to folk rock singer-songwriter David Crosby, who died at the age of 81, and Sister André, the world's oldest known person, who died at the age of 118. But that's not nearly all. Below is our weekly Saturday Six, a recap of half a dozen news stories — in no particular order — ranging from the heartfelt to the weird to the tragic, and everything in between. See you next week.
