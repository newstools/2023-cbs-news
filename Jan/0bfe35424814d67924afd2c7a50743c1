Five former Memphis, Tennessee,  officers who were fired over the death of Tyre Nichols have been charged with second-degree murder, according to online jail records. Nichols died after a violent arrest by police earlier this month. Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy is expected to hold a press conference Thursday afternoon  and was expected to be joined by the FBI. The five officers found to be "directly responsible for the physical abuse of Mr. Nichols" were fired last week, but Memphis Police Director Cerelyn "CJ" Davis said other officers are still being investigated for violating department policy. Nichols was Black, as are the five officers involved in the arrest. Video footage of the arrest has been shown to Nichols' family, but has not been made public, though local officials have pledged to release it this week or next week. Davis made a plea to residents of the city to protest peacefully when video of the arrest is released. "This is not just a professional failing. This is a failing of basic humanity toward another individual," Davis said in a video statement that was released late Wednesday on social media. Ben Crump, the attorney representing Nichols' family, said police video the family viewed showed Nichols — a 29-year-old FedEx worker and father — was shocked, pepper-sprayed and restrained when he was pulled over for a traffic stop near his home. Nichols was returning home from a suburban park, where he had taken photos of the sunset. The legal team said officers beat Nichols for three minutes in a "savage" encounter reminiscent of the infamous 1991 police beating of Los Angeles motorist Rodney King.
