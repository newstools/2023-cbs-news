Authorities will charge Brian Walshe with the murder of his wife Ana Walshe, who has been missing from her Cohasset home since Jan. 1, said Norfolk District Attorney Michael W. Morrissey. Police said that Ana Walshe's phone sent a ping to the couple's home on Jan. 1 and Jan. 2 after she left to take a ride share to Logan Airport in Boston for a flight to Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., but the 39-year-old mother of three hasn't been seen since. Since Jan. 9, Brian Walshe has been held on a $500,000 bond with initial charges of misleading investigators. Court documents said surveillance cameras at Home Depot captured him as he purchased about $450 of supplies. Items purchased included a mop, bucket and tarp, police said. He could be arraigned on murder charges as early as Wednesday morning, authorities said. The Norfolk District Attorney's Office has confirmed with defense counsel and court officials that Brian Walshe, 47, will be transported Wednesday to the Quincy District Court for arraignment on the murder warrant. Criminal defense attorney Tracey Miner will represent Brian Walshe.
