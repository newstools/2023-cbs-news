A gunman opened fire Friday night near a synagogue in east Jerusalem, killing at least seven people and wounding several before he was shot and killed, Israeli police and medics said. The shooting in the Jewish neighborhood of Neve Yaakov followed a deadly raid by the Israeli military Thursday in the occupied West Bank that killed nine Palestinians, with a 10th killed later north of Jerusalem. After Friday's shooting, a spokesman for the Magen David Adom emergency service said that in addition to those killed, three people had been taken to a hospital, including a 70-year-old in critical condition, a 20-year-old in serious condition, and a 14-year-old in moderate to serious condition. Israeli police said the gunman was shot and killed, and large police force was at the scene. On Twitter, Police Commissioner Yaakov ShabtaiÂ said the Jerusalem shooting was "a difficult and complex attack with a large number of casualties." Police said the attacker came from East Jerusalem. They said it appears he started shooting on the street prior his arrival at the synagogue, where worshippers were gathered for Shabbat evening prayers. "This is absolutely horrific," U.S. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters. "We condemn this apparent terrorist attack in the strongest terms. Our commitment to Israel's security remains ironclad, and we are in direct touch with our Israeli partners." Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to visit the region next week. Earlier, scuffles between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters erupted after the funeral for a 22-year-old Palestinian north of Jerusalem and elsewhere in the occupied West Bank.
