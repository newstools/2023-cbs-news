With no winning tickets sold for nearly three months, the Mega Millions jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion for Tuesday night's drawing, the lottery said. This marks the fifth largest lottery jackpot ever, and the third largest in Mega Millions history. There have been 24 drawings since the Mega Millions jackpot was last won on Oct. 14. The winning numbers for Friday's $940 million drawing were 3, 20, 46, 59, 63, and a Mega Ball of 13. A single jackpot winner for Tuesday's drawing would have the choice of getting a lump-sum cash payout of an estimated $576.8 million before taxes. Or, they could take the annuity option, which would consist of 29 annual payments. Each payment would average about $36.6 million, according to the lottery resource website USA Mega. After federal taxes, and before state taxes, the lump-sum payment would come out to about $363.4 million, per USA Mega. If there are multiple winners Tuesday, they would split the jackpot evenly. In November, a single winning Powerball ticket sold in the Los Angeles metro area won a $2.04 billion jackpot, the largest in lottery history. That winner has not yet been identified. A single South Carolina ticket claimed the largest Mega Millions jackpot ever at $1.537 billion in October 2018. And in July, a ticket sold in Illinois won a $1.337 billion Mega Millions jackpot, the second largest Mega Millions jackpot ever. The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are 1 in 302.6 million.
