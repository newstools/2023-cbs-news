Country music legend Dolly Parton, who just turned 77, has launched a new collection of Duncan Hines baking mixes in an expansion of her partnership with the company. Cornbread, biscuits and two brownie mixes are being added to her record-breaking baking mix line with Duncan Hines. They're set to be released at the end of the month and are expected to sell out fast. "You got to have some biscuits, you got to have some sweet cornbread, you got to have those fudgy brownie mix. So everybody loves all that ... and I know kind of about what Southern people like," Parton told "CBS Mornings." Parton launched the line just days before her 77th birthday, which she celebrated by releasing a new song, "Don't Make Me Have to Come Down There." "Today, I decided I'm not gonna get, I'm gonna give," she wrote on Instagram on her birthday, which was Thursday. She said her new single is about God being like a father. "It's like God talking, like, 'Don't make me have to come down there. My children, you had best beware. I let you try my patience, as all good fathers do, but you're on my last nerve, I have had it up to here with you,'" she said. The single is just one of the thousands of songs Parton has written in her iconic career that spans more than six decades. She was recently inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which led to her receiving a $100 million award from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to give to charities of her choice. Parton said she hasn't decided where she wants to donate the money yet but is determined to put it to good use. Her musical journey has been documented in country music history and in the hearts of all her fans, but if Hollywood were to make a movie about her life, Parton said the actor playing her would have to have her "spirit" and looks. "She'd have to be a little bit overexaggerated. But hopefully she â€” that would be pretty easy," Parton said.
