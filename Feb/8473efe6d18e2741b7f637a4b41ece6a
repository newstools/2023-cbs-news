The weekend is finally here. During yet another busy news week, we learned that the Food and Drug Administration hasn't reviewed some food additives in decades, a winter storm caused power outages, trapped drivers in vehicles and disrupted travel nationwide, and Rapper Nipsey Hussle's convicted killer was sentenced to 60 years to life in prison. Barbara Bosson of "Hill Street Blues" fame died at the age of 83, the creator of HBO's "Succession" announced it would end with season 4, and Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd talked to "CBS Mornings" about 2023 dating trends. But that's not nearly all. Below is our weekly Saturday Six, a recap of half a dozen news stories — in no particular order — ranging from the heartfelt to the weird to the tragic, and everything in between. See you next week.
