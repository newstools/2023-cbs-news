Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania was hospitalized Wednesday after "feeling lightheaded" while on a Senate Democratic retreat in Washington D.C., his office announced. Fetterman was driven by his staff to George Washington University Hospital, his office said in a statement late Wednesday night. "Initial tests did not show evidence of a new stroke, but doctors are running more tests and John is remaining overnight for observation," the statement read, adding that he was in "good spirits and talking with his staff and family." The 53-year-old Fetterman, then Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, suffered a stoke in May during his Senate campaign, and underwent surgery to implant a pacemaker. In October, he released a letter from his doctor saying he had "no work restrictions and can work full duty in public office." Still, the topic of his health became a central issue during the campaign, as Fetterman's Republican opponent, Dr. Mehmet Oz, repeatedly questioned whether Fetterman was fit to serve in the Senate. Fetterman acknowledged using a closed captioning device to read questions during interviews and in a late October debate with Oz, but repeatedly stressed he had been transparent about his health challenges and was improving each day. His auditory processing challenges were evident during his face-off with Oz, as he stumbled with his words at times and struggled at times to answer questions. Despite his health struggles, Fetterman still went on to defeat Oz, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, in November. His win over Oz helped Democrats grow their majority in the Senate from 50 to 51 seats. He attended President Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday night.
