Microsoft has unveiled an advanced version of its search engine Bing – complete with ChatGPT-like technology that can answer complex questions and help users make decisions. "We are basically taking the next generation of the model — that today powers ChatGPT — and building it in right into Bing," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told "CBS Mornings" co-host Tony Dokoupil before Tuesday's announcement. Microsoft has been pouring billions into artificial intelligence. Last month, the company announced it is making a "multiyear, multibillion dollar investment" in OpenAI, the AI research company behind ChatGPT — positioning Microsoft to sharpen its competition with Google in commercializing new AI breakthroughs. On stage Tuesday, executives from Microsoft and OpenAI demonstrated ways that the enhanced search tool would create a faster, more seamless experience. For instance, a user could request a list of events happening in a specific city during the Super Bowl; ask for the best cordless vacuum models; or whether an Ikea love seat will fit into a minivan. In response to the latter question, Bing can find the dimensions of the love seat and the car, and answer if it fits. Before Tuesday's announcement, Dokoupil asked Nadella: "What do you say to people watching who are worried that what you're building might make the economy grow but will disrupt their job and their life in ways that they cannot predict?" Nadella said the new technology still requires people to read, edit and approve content. He also said he believes Microsoft's AI work will create more "satisfaction in current jobs and net new jobs," claiming that wages could also go up as a result of the company's plans. Nadella's full conversation about Microsoft's announcement will air on "CBS Mornings" on Wednesday, Feb. 8.
