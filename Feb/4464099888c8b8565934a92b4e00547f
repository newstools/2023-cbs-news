A teenager was fatally shot at a county fair in a rural part of Florida known for its annual rodeos, authorities said Sunday. The Arcadia Police Department said in a statement that the shooting of the 17-year-old boy at the DeSoto County Fair on Saturday appeared to be an isolated incident and there was no further threat to the public. No suspect had been caught by midday Sunday. In a statement on Facebook, the police department said they wanted to identify three people seen in a video circulating on social media â€” a young female wearing a black jacket and light jeans, a male wearing a light shirt and shorts, and a man who appears to have a beard. The department posted images of the video. "These subjects may have valuable information and need to be spoken to," the department wrote. No further details were released. Because of the fatal shooting, the DeSoto County Fair Association closed the midway Sunday and said the only events taking place would be a livestock grooming contest and a Jr. Miss DeSoto County Pageant. The pageant would be limited to contestants, exhibitors and family members, the association said in a statement. Arcadia is located almost 90 miles southeast of Tampa. It is home to the state's oldest rodeo event, the Arcadia All-Florida Championship Rodeo.
