The Powerball jackpot rose to an estimated $747 million after no winning tickets were sold for Saturday's drawing. The massive winnings would be the ninth-largest in U.S. lottery history. The next drawing will be on Monday night at 10:59 p.m. ET, with the odds of winning just 1 in 292.2 million. The huge prize is the latest in a string of recent sizeable lottery jackpots. A massive $1.35 billion Mega Millions jackpot winner in Maine was announced last month. In recent years, Mega Millions has taken steps to make it harder to draw a winning number, such as increasing the cost of a ticket and allowing players more numbers to choose from, which decreases the overall winning odds. For Powerball, low odds of matching all six numbers and a recently added third drawing per week allow jackpots to increase fairly quickly over the course of months, with the last Powerball winner taking home a whopping $2 billion last November. The Powerball lottery is available in 45 out of 50 U.S. states, in addition to Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
