Humanitarian worker and U.S. Marine Corps veteran Pete Reed was killed while aiding civilians in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on Thursday, according to his family and the group Global Response Medicine. Reed, who served two deployments as a Marine rifleman in Afghanistan, founded the nonprofit in 2017. In January, Reed stepped away from Global Response Medicine to work with Global Outreach Doctors on their Ukraine mission, and was killed while rendering aid, the organization said. The city of Bakhmut has been the focus of intense fighting in recent weeks. "He was evacuating citizens and responding to those wounded when his ambulance was shelled," his wife Alex Kay Potter said in a Facebook post. This is a developing story and will be updated.
