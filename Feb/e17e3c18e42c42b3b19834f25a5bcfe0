A Florida judge has issued an arrest warrant for rapper Kodak Black for failing a drug test while on bail for a drug charge, court records show. The warrant was issued Thursday after Black, whose real name is Bill Kapri, did not appear for a scheduled drug test in early February and then days later submitted a sample that tested positive for fentanyl, according to records. Broward County Judge Barbara Duffy issued the warrant and wrote that the rapper had violated the conditions of his pretrial release for an oxycodone trafficking charge from July. Black pleaded not guilty to the trafficking charge. In January 2020, then-President Donald Trump commuted a three-year federal prison sentence the rapper had for falsifying documents used to buy weapons. Black had served about half his sentence. Black, who has been nominated for this year's iHeartRadio Music Awards' hip-hop artist of the year,Â has sold more than 30 million singles; his massive hit "Super Gremlin" reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 last year.
