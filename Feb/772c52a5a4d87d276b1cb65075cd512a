Super Bowl LVII got off to an intense start on Sunday, with strong offensive displays showing why the Eagles and the Chiefs got to this highly anticipated matchup. Jalen Hurts made up for a costly fumble earlier in the second quarter, which helped the Chiefs tie 14-14, with his second rushing touchdown of the evening a few minutes later. That's how the Eagles regained the lead, 21-14. Prior to the game, Cody Benjamin of CBS Sports wrote that the game  "features two of the most prolific offenses the NFL has seen this year, with Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts set to square off in a battle of MVP candidates. Not only that, but the championship showdown will pit Chiefs coach Andy Reid against Philadelphia, the city in which he built his NFL career; and Pro Bowl brothers Travis and Jason Kelce against each other for a chance at their second respective Lombardi trophies." History was also made Sunday by Mahomes and Hurts, marking the first time that a Super Bowl featured two starting Black quarterbacks. The halftime show will be headlined by Grammy Award-winning pop star Rihanna. Her performance has been highly anticipated because it has been nearly seven years since she last performed on stage. She has also not released an album since 2016's "Anti." Grammy-winning country music star Chris Stapleton performed the pregame national anthem, and Grammy-winning R&B artist Babyface performed "America the Beautiful" before kickoff.
