Britain's Queen Consort Camilla, the wife of King Charles III, has tested positive for coronavirus, Buckingham Palace said Monday. It's the second time she has caught COVID-19. "After suffering the symptoms of a cold, Her Majesty The Queen Consort has tested positive for the COVID virus," said a statement from the palace. As a result, she has canceled all public engagements for this week. It is almost a year since Camilla, 75, tested positive for the virus for the first time, a few days after her husband — then Prince Charles — caught the disease.
