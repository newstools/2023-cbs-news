The weekend is finally here. During another busy news week, a major ice storm swept across the U.S. and left thousands without power, Tyre Nichols was laid to rest, Dr. Phil announced his show was coming to an end after 21 seasons and Tom Brady retired — "for good" this time. Meanwhile, Alec Baldwin was formally charged in the "Rust" film set shooting, we learned about the effects of "layoff survivor guilt" and reported the news that actors Cindy Williams and Lisa Loring had died. In music news, Beyoncé announced her Renaissance tour dates while Ozzy Osbourne said he's no longer "physically capable" of going out on the road. Oh, and the 2023 Grammy Awards will be held on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET, airing live on CBS and streaming on Paramount +. More on that here. But that's not nearly all. Below is our weekly Saturday Six, a recap of half a dozen news stories — in no particular order — ranging from the heartfelt to the weird to the tragic, and everything in between. See you next week.
