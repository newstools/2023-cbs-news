A 2-year-old girl and five teenagers were among seven people wounded in a shooting Thursday evening outside an elementary school in Philadelphia, officials said. The shooting was reported at about 6 p.m. ET outside the James G. Blaine School in the Strawberry Mansion neighborhood, CBS Philadelphia reported. The Associated Press cites Philadelphia School Board President Reginald Streater as saying the shooting occurred as a non-school event was coming to  a close. Six people, ranging in age from 2 to 31, were taken to local hospitals with gunshot wounds, police said. All were reported to be in stable condition as of Thursday night. Police said they are looking for three male suspects and a 2011-16 gray, 4-door Hyundai Elantra with a Pennsylvania license plate, according to CBS Philadelphia. All three were seen in surveillance photos wearing black clothing, including masks or hooded sweatshirts, at the time of the shooting. One of the suspects appeared to be wearing a black sweater with the New Balance logo on the front. The 2-year-old girl was shot once in the leg, according to police, and a 15-year-old boy was struck twice in the chest and once in the right thigh, police said. A 16-year-old boy was struck twice by gunfire — once in the arm and in the leg, police disclosed, while another 16-year-old boy was shot once in the arm. A 13-year-old boy was shot in the hand, police said. A 31-year-old woman was shot twice in the leg, police said. A 17-year-old boy suffered a graze wound on his left thigh and was taken to the hospital by an Uber, police said. No suspects have been arrested, police said, and there was no word on a motive. The circumstances of the shooting were still unclear. According to CBS Philadelphia, police found about 28 shell casings at the scene. -- additional reporting by Brian Dakss
